# Simon-Says-Game

**Objective:** 

The objective of the Simon Says game is to follow a sequence of colors or patterns generated by the game.

#Game Rules: 
The game starts with a single color or pattern shown by the computer. The player must then repeat the same sequence by clicking on the colors or buttons in the correct order. If the player correctly repeats the sequence, the game adds another color or pattern to the sequence. If the player makes a mistake and clicks the wrong color or pattern, the game ends.

#Implementation Steps:

1).HTML Structure: 
Create an HTML file with buttons for different colors (e.g., red, green, blue, yellow). Add a display area to show the current sequence and player's input. 

2).CSS Styling: 
Style the buttons and display area to make the game visually appealing. 

3).JavaScript Logic: 
Create an array to store the sequence of colors or patterns. Initialize variables to track the current sequence, player's input, and game state. Implement functions to generate a new random color or pattern, display the current sequence, handle player input, and check if the player's input matches the sequence. Use event listeners to detect button clicks and handle player input. Continuously add new colors or patterns to the sequence as the player progresses. End the game and display a message when the player makes a mistake.
#Game Flow:
The game generates and displays the initial sequence (e.g., red, green, blue). The player clicks on the buttons in the correct order to repeat the sequence. If the player's input matches the sequence, the game adds another color to the sequence. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends and displays a message (e.g., "Game Over!"). The player can choose to restart the game to play again.

#Game Interaction: 
The player interacts with the game by clicking on colored buttons to repeat the sequence shown by the game. The game responds to player input, adds new colors to the sequence, and ends when the player makes a mistake.

#Conclusion: 
The Simon Says game is a fun and interactive way to test memory and attention skills while enjoying a classic game experience. Implementing this game will involve combining HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic and interactivity. Adjust the game's complexity and features as needed to create an enjoyable gaming experience.
